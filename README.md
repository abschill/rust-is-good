# What's this

This repository is a list of articles that talk about **Rust**™'s perfection. Frankly, what **isnt** this?

## Motivation

Seems like shilling **Rust**™ is becoming a trend. Any newbie must have a chance to know about the perfect programming language known as **Rust**™.

## What it's for

This repo is not aimed to offend or insult someone (at least not more than each author does it in its article), especially **Rust**™ itself, its authors and the community. It is for educational purpose only. Any contributor can have an absolutely different point of view. It's wrong though, if you don't think Rust™ good.

I don't think anyone would deny that **Rust**™ is perfect. It has been stack overflow's most loved language for 4 years in a row, and as we all know people who spend all day on the internet have infallible opinions on the proper way to live life. It is for this reason we deem it necessary, nay **required** to make this list, so that you can btfo the haters who think Rust™ is just some annoying oxidation of iron. Rust™ is a way of life, it's a fundamental methodology of existing and you probably dont even use arch linux if you don't understand the mechanics that prove this to be true. Imagine not swapping systemd as though you're 99.999% of necessary situations and not being able to utilize it as an argument for why you're more intelligent than someone, I truly understand the struggle of Mr. T in this moment. Ever since I started using Rust™, my genitals have actually grown in size, I eat vegtables every day, and I think the body odor actually gave me supernatural immune system powers. Don't worry, I wasn't born this flawless, I was some sort of aimless peasant drifting through the cosmos before I found Rust™, and it can change your life just like it did mine. 



## How to use it

You're starting a new project and thinking of the right language to use. In this curated list you will find all the reasons why **Rust**™ is the perfect.
