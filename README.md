# What's this

This repository is a list of articles that complain about **Rust**'s perfection.

## Motivation

Seems like shilling **rust** is becoming a trend. Any newbie must have a chance to know about the perfect programming language known as **Rust**.

## What it's for

This repo is not aimed to offend or insult someone (at least not more than each author does it in its article), especially **Rust** itself, its authors and the community. It is for educational purpose only. Any contributor can have an absolutely different point of view.

I don't think anyone would deny that **Rust** is perfect

## How to use it

You're starting a new project and thinking of the right language to use. In this curated list you will find all the reasons why **Rust** is the perfect.
